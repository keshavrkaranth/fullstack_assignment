# fullstack_assignment

- The assignment must be completed in a fork of this repo. Once you have completed, submit a PR which will notify us that you are ready for us to review your work.
- Feel free to reach out (utkarsh@deeplogicai.tech) in case of any issues or concerns, even if you are simply facing difficulty completing the assignment. Effective communication is an important skill.
- Googling is yet another very useful skill, use it wherever you get stuck.
- There is no hard-and-fast time limit on completing this assignment, you are expected to send in your submission as soon as you are done. __Just make sure it is submitted before the deadline conveyed in the message in which you received the link to this assignment.__

The assignment consists of mainly two parts - 
- Building APIs
- Consuming APIs

## 1. Building APIs
You must complete the following using Python and Django framework (any database of your choice). The APIs should cover the following bare minimum - 
- User authentication
- A table consisting of restaurant details (id, name, address); another table containing dishes (id, name, thumbnail path); and a final table restuarant dish mapping (restuarant_id, dish_id)

Points to note -
- Bonus points for using any database other than sqlite. (Preferred PostgreSQL).
- Bonus points for using custom authentication backend (example, using phone number and OTP instead of Django's default username/password).

## 2. Consuming APIs
Create a __responsive__ (mobile & desktop) web client which shows listing of restaurants (after fetching restaurants via the API) and on clicking a restaurant, shows the dishes that particular restaurant serves. For authentication, create a login and singup page as well and appropriately consume the auth APIs here.
Points to note -
- There is a lot of creative freedom here which has been given to not limit the thinking of the applicant and to provide room for flexibility. Use it to your advantage.
- Bonus points for using specifically Bootstrap for responsiveness.
- The frontend is expected to be modern & beautiful (maybe for inspiration - https://startbootstrap.com/previews/sb-admin-2 or any other themes from websites such as colorlib; or even Swiggy/Zomato if you're feeling particularly bold!). Don't hesitate to use templates/themes to make a great frontend.

## Other Important points
- Please include detailed instructions to run the app, including dependencies list (preferably, requirements.txt) and installation guidelines (README). 
- It would be terrific if you are able to deploy it (perhaps using Heroku or GCP free $300 credits) and include a link to the hosted app, but it is __not mandatory__. 
- Comment your code wherever required.
- We suggest you do not spend more than 2 days completing this assignment. Again, if you have any concerns whatsoever, please feel free to reach out!

## ALL THE BEST!
